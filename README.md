# Quartus-runable-Processor-with-command-encoded-PGA-MAX-10-
32-bit microprocessor  with  an  instruction  set  that  is  similar  to  a  MIPS. 
(not orginal work, from digital design class)
To run you need quartus and max 10 programmale device, map the switches to inputs of memory file in quartus to input commands, map the outputs to led of board, outputs are in bits

Intruction set:
